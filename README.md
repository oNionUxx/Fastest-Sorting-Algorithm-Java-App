# Program to determines which sorting algorithm under the right circumstances is the fastest.

  #Featuers: 
  
    4 folders of strings order type :
    ---------------------------------
      a. Semi-Sorted Strings
      b. Strings In Ascending Order
      c. Strings In Descending Order
      d. Unsorted Strings
      
     Each folder has 4
     types of strings sizes :
     ----------------------------------
      a. 1m strings
      b. 500k strings
      c. 250k strings
      d. 50k strings
      
     3 type of sorting algorithms :
     ------------------------------
      a. Merge Sort
      b. Insertion Sort
      c. Radix Sort
      
      - Each folder is being sorted by each type of the sorting algorithm.
      - The program repeats the action above for 5 times.
      - Then, calculates the avergae time and presents the time elapsed in nano seconds.
      
  **Note** The program uses the sorting algorithms mentioned above but, can be applyed to any given sorting alogrithm **Note**
